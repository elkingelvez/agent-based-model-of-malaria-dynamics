# Agent-Based Model for Malaria Dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia
This repository contains Python code implementing an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate malaria dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia, as described in the corresponding scientific article. Two main scripts are provided to run the simulations with or without animation.

# Repository Structure
- src/malariaABM.c: Core C file for the agent-based malaria simulation.
- bin/: Compiled executables (.exe, .o) for quick use.
- results/: .txt files containing outputs from individual simulation runs.
- matlab/: MATLAB scripts to generate graphs and analyze simulation outputs.

# Reproducibility and Extension
- Both scripts share core model components to ensure consistent results.
- Parameters and simulation settings are commented and adjustable within each script.
- Additional documentation and flowcharts are available in docs/ for deeper understanding.
