# Agent-Based Model for Malaria Dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia
This repository contains Python code implementing an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate malaria dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia, as described in the corresponding scientific article. Two main scripts are provided to run the simulations with or without animation.

# Repository Structure
- FINAL1.py: Runs the full agent-based simulation with animation, visualizing agent interactions and disease spread dynamics in real-time.
- FINAL2.py: Runs the simulation without animation, optimized for batch runs or longer simulations where visualization is not needed.

# Reproducibility and Extension
- Both scripts share core model components to ensure consistent results.
- Parameters and simulation settings are commented and adjustable within each script.
- Additional documentation and flowcharts are available in docs/ for deeper understanding.
