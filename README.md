# Agent-Based Model for Malaria Dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia
This repository contains Python code implementing an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate malaria dynamics in Quibdó, Colombia, as described in the corresponding scientific article. Two main scripts are provided to run the simulations with or without animation.
# Repository Structur
- FINAL1.py: Runs the full agent-based simulation with animation, visualizing agent interactions and disease spread dynamics in real-time.
- FINAL2.py: Runs the simulation without animation, optimized for batch runs or longer simulations where visualization is not needed.
